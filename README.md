# Portfolio
This is my personal work portfolio.  Right now, I have only one deployed project that I created,
so a large portion of my work focuses on the mathematics and computer programming I've done in 
the past.  In the future, I intend to put separate sections for each facet of my life.  These 
sections will include math, programming, web development, and volunteer work.  Currently, there
is no content on my resume.  I will fix that in the future as I develop a professional resume.
