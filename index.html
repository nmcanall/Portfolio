                    Upon completion of high school, I went to The Citadel on a four-year Marine Corps Scholarship.  While the main goal was just to graduate and begin my career as a Marine Corps officer, I was dead set on succeeding in a difficult program of study: mathematics.  The one fear of the mathematics degree program was the one computer programming class during my sophomore year.  Little did I know I would fall in love with programming just as much as mathematics.  Unfortunately, the late start to the program did not provide enough time for a double major, so I settled with a minor.  After four years, I graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics with a emphasis on number theory, a minor in computer programming, and a commission in the United States Marine Corps.

                    My next requirement was four years as an active duty officer.  While I am still serving and thoroughly enjoying the service, my devotion to mathematics and programming have not faltered.  I enjoy studying fractal geometry while off duty; while I can manage the rigors of computational programming for fractals, I am just beginning to develop the web development skills necessary to show off fractal designs.  I will continue to study mathematics, but I intend to use web development to support recreational and feature recreational mathematics.  The ability to link mathematics, programming, and web development provides an advantage to design philosophy and website functionality.
